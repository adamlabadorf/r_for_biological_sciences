[["index.html", "R for Biological Sciences BF591 - R for Biological Sciences Course Schedule Course Values and Policies", " R for Biological Sciences BF591 - R for Biological Sciences Under construction Semester: Spring 2022 Location: NA Time: NA This course introduces the R programming language through the lens of practitioners in the biological sciences, particularly biology and bioinformatics. Key concepts and patterns of the language are covered, including: RStudio Data wrangling with tidyverse Data visualization with ggplot Essential biological data shapes and formats Core bioconductor packages Basic data exploration, including elementary statistical modeling and summarization “Toolifying” R scripts Communicating R code and results with RMarkdown Buidling R packages and unit testing strategies Building interactive tools with RShiny About 1/3 of the materials are inspired by the online textbook R for Data Science, while the rest has been developed by practicing bioinformaticians based on their experiences. Weekly programming assignments will help students apply these techniques to realistic problems involving analysis and visualization of biological data. Students will be introduced to a unit testing paradigm that will help them write correct code and deposit all their code into github for evaluation. The course materials are aligned with BF528 Applications in Translational Bioinformatics and are intended to be taken in tandem, but the materials also stand alone as an independent class.

Every background, race, color, creed, religion, ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, nationality is welcome and celebrated in this course. Everyone deserves respect, patience, and kindness. Disrespectful language, discrimination, or harassment of any kind are not tolerated, and may result in removal from class or the University. This is not merely BU policy. The instructors deem these principles to be inviolable human rights. Students should feel safe reporting any and all instances of discrimination or harassment to the instructor, to any of the Bioinformatics Program leadership, or the BU Equal Opportunity Office. Everyone brings value. Each of us brings unique experiences, skills, and creativity to this course. Our diversity is our greatest asset. Collaboration is highly encouraged. All students are encouraged to work together and seek out any and all available resources when completing projects in all aspects of the course, including sharing coding ideas and strategies with each other as well as those found on the internet. Any and all available resources may be brought to bear. However, consistent with BU policy, the bulk of your code and your final reports should be written in your own words and represent your own work and understanding of the material. Copying/pasting large sections of code is not acceptable and will be investigated as cheating (we check). A safe space for dissent. For complex topics such as those covered in this class, there is seldom one correct answer, approach, or solution. Disagreement fosters innovation. All in the course, including students and TAs, are encouraged to express constructive criticism and alternative ideas on any aspect of the content. We are always learning. Our knowledge and understanding is always incomplete. Even experts are fallible. The bioinformatics field evolves rapidly, and Rome was not built in a day. Be kind to yourself and to others. You are always smarter and more knowledgable today than you were yesterday. "],["basics.html", "1 Basics", " 1 Basics These are the bass icks.
